		About Me
	</font></h1>
	<font face="helvetica" color="black" size="3">
		Growing up an Afro-Hispanic in the Bronx wasn't always the easiest. Being surrounded in a harsher environment than most allowed me to learn many things that would ultimately shape the way I view life as a whole. As I grew passions for basketball and music which allowed me to learn many skills like Leadership, Awareness, and Communication which is key in everyday life. Thus allowing me to thrive in any aspect of work from the many jobs I've worked - Brand Ambassador (business), School Assistant,etc.

   		<td>[Piece 2: In this piece I tried to capture the pure opposite of penguin-ness. The design was especially challenging here because representing objects along a four-dimensional plane proved to require more string theory than I had originally hoped.]</td>
   		<td>[Piece 3: This piece was inspired by the Oregon Trail during a zombie apocalypse. In the multiplicity of materials used, I tried to symbolize the lingering interposition of the Freudian superego along Jungian archetypes throughout Viennese architecture.]</td>
